ReadMe.txt - Adv.PHP and MySQL - Fall 2010 - Exam 2

The final exam consists of 4 programming problems. Each problem is primarily
explained in files named: exam2p1.php, exam2p2.php, exam2p3.php and exam2p4.php

Follow the instructions in each file to complete that problem. Each problem is
worth 10-15 points. Exam 2 is worth a total of 50 points.

For all 4 problems, you must implement the following "best practices":

1) Set the directive "magic_quotes_gpc" in your php.ini file to 'Off'.
2) Use the mysqli prepare statement and bind variables for all database queries.
3) Output to the database should still be escaped to prevent problems with bad
   string values, etc.
4) Any output sent to the browser should be filtered to prevent malicious users
   from sending HTML or PHP tags to the browser.

For questions or problems, send me an email at djefferson@matcmadison.edu .

The completed script files should be submitted on Blackboard by Midnight on
Thursday, December 16th, 2010. I will be in our class room at the time of the
regularly scheduled final exam period to answer questions. That will be Tuesday,
December 14th from 12:30 until 2:20 pm, for the day section, and Thursday,
December 16th from 5:30 until 9 pm for the evening section.

You are not required to come to class the week of December 13-17. Only come if
you wish to ask questions about the exam!
